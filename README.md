# OSC-XR
### A Toolkit for Extended Reality (XR) Immersive Music Interfaces

OSC-XR, a toolkit for rapidly prototyping immersive musical environments in XR using [Open Sound Control (OSC)](http://opensoundcontrol.org/introduction-osc), a communication protocol widely used in audio software. Influenced by multi-touch OSC controllers, OSC-XR provides designers with a wide range of readily available components in order to make designing immersive environment more accessible to researchers and sound designers.

## OSC-XR Prefab Controllers
Adding OSC controller prefabs to a Unity scene is the quickest way to get started with OSC-XR. To implement a controller simply add the prefab from the `OSCXR/Prefabs` folder to the Unity game hierarchy.

### Currently Available Prefabs

## OSC-XR Scripting Interface
OSC-XR scripting allows developers to quickly add OSC capabilities to any Unity `GameObject` by attaching any of the readily available controller scripts to the object.
